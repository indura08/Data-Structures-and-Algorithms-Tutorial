What is a Stack?

A stack is a simple data structure that works like a pile of plates. Think of this:

You add plates on top of the stack (Push operation).
You remove plates from the top of the stack (Pop operation).
The stack works on the LIFO principle:

LIFO = Last In, First Out.
The last item you add is the first one you take out.

Basic Operations of a Stack

Push: Add an item to the stack.
Pop: Remove the top item from the stack.
Peek (or Top): Look at the top item without removing it.
isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.

Real-Life Examples of a Stack

Undo feature in text editors (last action undone first).
Browser history (the last visited page is the first to go back to).
Backtracking (like solving mazes or puzzles).
Stack of plates: You can only add or remove plates from the top.
Function call stack: Keeps track of the order of function calls in a program.
Undo/Redo functionality: Stores actions in a stack for easy reversal.
