1️⃣ What is Linear Search? (Core Idea)
----------------------------------------

Linear Search is the simplest searching algorithm.

You check elements one by one, from start to end, until:

you find the target, or

you reach the end of the collection

No assumptions.
No sorting required.
Just brute-force truth.

4️⃣ Time Complexity (THIS is where seniors differ)
-----------------------------------------

⏱ Worst Case: O(n)

Target is at the end or not present

You check every element

⚡ Best Case: O(1)

Target is the first element

📊 Average Case: O(n)

On average, you scan about n / 2 elements

📌 Key senior insight
Big-O ignores constants → average is still O(n).


5️⃣ Space Complexity
-------------------

💾 Space: O(1)

Uses a constant amount of memory

No extra data structures

6️⃣ When SHOULD You Use Linear Search?
-----------------------------------

A senior engineer does not ask “Is it fast?”
They ask “Is it appropriate?”

✅ Good choice when:

Data size is small

Data is unsorted

Data is dynamic

Only one search

Simplicity > performance

Examples:

Config files

User input validation

Small arrays

One-time lookups


This is why linear search is memory-friendly.

9️⃣ Variants of Linear Search (Important!)
----------------------------------

1️⃣ Search & Return Index
return index;

2️⃣ Search & Return Boolean
return true / false;

3️⃣ Find All Occurrences
function findAll(arr: number[], target: number): number[] {
  const result: number[] = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] === target) result.push(i);
  }
  return result;
}

4️⃣ Sentinel Linear Search (Optimization)

Place target at end

Avoid bounds checking inside loop

Used in low-level performance code

🔥 10️⃣ Senior-Level Insights (This Is Gold)
-------------------------------------

1️⃣ Linear Search is a baseline

Every advanced search algorithm is compared against it.

2️⃣ Cache friendliness

Sequential memory access = CPU cache friendly
Sometimes linear search beats binary search on very small arrays.

3️⃣ Linked Lists

Linear search is the only option for linked lists.

4️⃣ Databases & Systems

Table scans = linear search

Used when indexes don’t exist
