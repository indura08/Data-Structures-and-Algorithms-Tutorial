1️⃣ What is a Tree data structure (fundamentals)

A tree is just a way to store data hierarchically (not linearly like arrays or linked lists).

Core ideas (these apply to all trees)

Node → a single data item

Root → top node

Child → node below another node

Parent → node above

Leaf → node with no children

Edge → connection between nodes

Height / Depth → distance levels

👉 These concepts are universal — no matter what tree you study.

2️⃣ Is Binary Search Tree (BST) the only tree?
❌ NO — absolutely NOT

This is where many tutorials mislead beginners.

👉 BST is just ONE type of tree, and honestly not even the most used one in real systems.

Think of it like this:

Tree = category
BST = one member inside that category

3️⃣ Big picture: Types of Trees (important)

Here is the correct hierarchy 👇

Tree
├── General Tree
├── Binary Tree
│   ├── Full Binary Tree
│   ├── Complete Binary Tree
│   ├── Perfect Binary Tree
│   ├── Binary Search Tree (BST)
│   │   ├── AVL Tree
│   │   └── Red-Black Tree
│   └── Heap (Min Heap / Max Heap)
├── Trie
├── B-Tree
│   └── B+ Tree
└── Segment Tree


Now we’ll go through each one, clearly and calmly.

4️⃣ General Tree
Definition

A node can have any number of children

Example use

File systems

Organization hierarchy

Key point

No strict rules

Most flexible

Rarely used directly in algorithms

5️⃣ Binary Tree (foundation for many trees)
Definition

Each node has at most 2 children

left

right

⚠️ No ordering rule yet

Variants of Binary Trees
Full Binary Tree

Each node has 0 or 2 children

Complete Binary Tree

All levels filled except possibly last

Filled left to right

👉 Heap uses this structure

Perfect Binary Tree

All levels completely filled

Mostly theoretical, rarely practical.

6️⃣ Binary Search Tree (BST)
Definition

A binary tree with ordering rules:

Left subtree  <  Node  <  Right subtree

Properties

In-order traversal gives sorted data

Search / insert / delete → O(log n) (if balanced)

Problems

Can become skewed

Worst case → O(n)

⚠️ That’s why BST alone is not enough

7️⃣ Self-balancing BSTs (VERY important)

These exist to fix BST’s problems

AVL Tree

Strictly balanced

Faster lookups

More rotations

Red-Black Tree

Loosely balanced

Faster inserts/deletes

Used in real systems

📌 Examples:

Java TreeMap

C++ map

Linux kernel scheduling

8️⃣ Heap (you already touched this 👍)
Definition

A Complete Binary Tree

Ordering rule:

Max Heap → parent ≥ children

Min Heap → parent ≤ children

Used for

Priority Queue

Heap Sort

Scheduling

Dijkstra algorithm

⚠️ Heap is NOT a BST

9️⃣ Trie (Prefix Tree)
Definition

Tree for strings

Each node represents a character

Used for

Autocomplete

Spell check

Search suggestions

📌 Google search box uses this concept

🔟 B-Tree & B+ Tree (database trees)
Why they exist

BSTs are bad for disk-based storage

Properties

Nodes store multiple keys

Very shallow height

Optimized for disk reads

Used in

MySQL

PostgreSQL

File systems

👉 Most important trees in databases

1️⃣1️⃣ Segment Tree
Used for

Range queries

Competitive programming

Analytics

Not common in business apps, but powerful.

1️⃣2️⃣ So why do tutorials start with BST?
Simple reason:

Easy to explain

Builds recursion understanding

Foundation for advanced trees

But BST is NOT the goal, it’s just a learning step.

1️⃣3️⃣ Real-world usage summary (very important)

| Tree Type        | Used in Industry? |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| BST              | ⚠️ Rare (raw)     |
| AVL Tree         | ✅ Sometimes       |
| Red-Black Tree   | ✅ YES             |
| Heap             | ✅ YES             |
| Trie             | ✅ YES             |
| B-Tree / B+ Tree | ✅ YES (DBs)       |
| Segment Tree     | ❌ Mostly academic |
