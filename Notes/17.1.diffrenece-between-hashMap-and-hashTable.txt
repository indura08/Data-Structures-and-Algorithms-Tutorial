🔑 Short answer (memorize this)

A hash table is the data structure.
A hash map is an implementation or usage of that data structure.

Most of the time:
👉 They mean the same thing in practice.

1️⃣ What is a Hash Table? (the core concept)

A hash table is:

A low-level data structure that:

Uses a hash function

Stores data in an array

Handles collisions

It describes how things work internally.

Think of it as:

Buckets

Hash function

Collision handling

Resizing logic

📌 This is the theory + structure

2️⃣ What is a Hash Map? (what programmers use)

A hash map is:

A high-level abstraction built on top of a hash table.

It exposes:

put(key, value)
get(key)
delete(key)


You don’t see:

Buckets

Hash math

Collision handling

📌 This is the API you use

3️⃣ Why languages use different names
Java
HashMap
Hashtable

HashMap	Hashtable
Not synchronized	Synchronized
Faster	Slower
Modern	Legacy

👉 Both are hash tables internally

JavaScript / TypeScript
Map
Object

Map	Object
Real hash map	Pseudo hash
Any key type	String keys
Predictable	Prototype issues
Python
dict


Called dict

Implemented using a hash table

C++
unordered_map

4️⃣ Why people say “hash map” more often

Because:

Developers think in terms of key-value mapping

Not internal memory layout

So:

CS textbooks → “hash table”

Application devs → “hash map”

5️⃣ Are they different in performance?

❌ No.

Both have:

O(1) average lookup

O(n) worst case

Same collision issues

6️⃣ Senior-level explanation (important)

Hash table = implementation detail
Hash map = interface / usage

Just like:

ArrayList vs dynamic array

Stack vs array-based stack

7️⃣ When the difference actually matters

Only when talking about:

Thread safety (Java)

Memory layout

Low-level system design

Interview theory questions

In real code:

const map = new Map();


You are using a hash table, whether you say it or not.

8️⃣ Common interview trap (be ready)

❓ “Difference between HashMap and Hashtable?”

Correct answer:

“A hash table is the underlying data structure, while HashMap is a concrete implementation that provides a key-value interface.”

🧠 Final mental model (keep this forever)
Hash Function
     ↓
Hash Table (data structure)
     ↓
Hash Map (API you use)

✅ Final takeaway

If someone says:

“Hash map” → they mean hash table

“Hash table” → they mean hash map

Context decides the meaning

You are not missing anything — this is just naming confusion in CS history.
