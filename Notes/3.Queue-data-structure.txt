What is a Queue?

A queue is a data structure that works just like a real-world queue or lineâ€”First In, First Out (FIFO). This means:

First element added is the first element removed.
Think of people standing in line for tickets: the first person in line gets served first, and new people join the back of the line.

Basic Operations in a Queue

Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue (like joining the line).
Dequeue: Remove the element at the front of the queue (like the person at the front being served).
Peek/Front: Look at the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty

Real-World Examples

Bank Queue: People wait in a line to be served one by one.
Printer Queue: Print jobs are executed in the order they were added.
Call Center: Calls are answered in the order they are received
