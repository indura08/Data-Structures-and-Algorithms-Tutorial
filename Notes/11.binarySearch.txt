1️⃣ What Is Binary Search? (Core Idea)
---------------------------------------

Binary search finds a target value by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

Instead of checking elements one by one (linear search), it:

Looks at the middle

Decides which half to keep

Discards the other half entirely


🔑 The Golden Rule (Non-Negotiable)
--------------------------------------

Binary search ONLY works on sorted data

If the data is not sorted → binary search is invalid.

A senior engineer always states this first.

3️⃣ Formal Definition (Interview-Level)
--------------------------------
Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that locates a target value in a sorted collection by repeatedly comparing the target to the middle element and narrowing the search range by half.


7️⃣ Time Complexity (This Is Why It’s Famous)
--------------------------------------

⏱ Time Complexity: O(log n)

Each step halves the problem.

Example:

1,000,000 elements

Max comparisons ≈ 20

This is huge in systems design.

9️⃣ Binary Search Preconditions (Interview MUST)
------------------------------------------

A senior engineer explicitly states:

Data must be sorted

Random access required (arrays, not linked lists)

12️⃣ Binary Search on “Answer Space” (VERY SENIOR)
----------------------------------------------

Not just arrays.

Examples:

Minimum capacity

Maximum speed

Optimal value

Pattern:

“Find the smallest X such that condition(X) is true”

This is binary search on a function.

16️⃣ Interview Gold Answers
-------------------------

❓ “Why binary search is not always better?”

💡 Answer:

Because it requires sorted data and random access; for small or unsorted datasets, linear search is simpler and often faster.

❓ “Why is binary search O(log n)?”

💡 Answer:

Because each iteration halves the remaining search space.
