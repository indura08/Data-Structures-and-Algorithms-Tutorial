🧠 Why starting with BST is the RIGHT move

BST teaches you core tree skills that every other tree depends on:

What BST gives you (very important)

By implementing a BST, you will learn:

Node-based thinking

left child

right child

recursion

Tree traversal logic

In-order

Pre-order

Post-order

Recursive problem solving

Every advanced tree uses recursion

Search & insert patterns

Used again in AVL, Red-Black, B-Trees

Comparisons & ordering

Critical for all balanced trees

👉 Without BST knowledge, AVL / Red-Black trees will feel impossible.

❌ Common mistake (you are NOT doing this 👍)

Many people:

Learn BST

Stop there

Think they “know trees”

You are not doing that — you plan to go deeper. That’s perfect.

📌 Using TypeScript = VERY good choice

Since you’re implementing in TypeScript, this is actually better than Java/C++ for learning because:

You must build everything yourself

No built-in tree shortcuts

Forces you to understand references clearly

You’ll learn:

Class-based design

Recursion with types

Edge cases clearly

So: TypeScript is an excellent learning language for trees.

🗺️ Recommended learning path (tree roadmap)

Your plan is correct — here’s the ideal order (stick to this):

Phase 1: Foundations

Binary Tree (concepts only)

Binary Search Tree

insert

search

traversals

delete (important)

👉 Implement BST fully in TypeScript ✅

Phase 2: Improving BST

AVL Tree

rotations

Red-Black Tree

balancing rules (conceptual)

Phase 3: Specialized Trees

Heap

Trie

B-Tree / B+ Tree (conceptual + usage)

⚠️ One important warning (read carefully)

When learning BST, do NOT jump immediately into balancing.

First make sure you can:

Draw the tree by hand

Predict traversal output

Explain recursion line-by-line

If you rush:

AVL rotations will break your brain 😄
