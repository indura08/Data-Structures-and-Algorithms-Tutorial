🧩 Insertion Sort — Complete Explanation
1️⃣ What Is Insertion Sort? (Plain English)

Insertion Sort works the way you sort playing cards in your hand:

Take one element at a time and insert it into its correct position in the already-sorted part of the array.

2️⃣ Core Idea (Very Important)

The array is split into two parts:

| Sorted | Unsorted |


Initially: first element is considered sorted

One by one, elements from the unsorted part are inserted into the correct position in the sorted part

3️⃣ Step-by-Step Example

Array:

[8, 3, 5, 2, 6]

Step 1
[8 | 3, 5, 2, 6]

Step 2 – insert 3
[3, 8 | 5, 2, 6]

Step 3 – insert 5
[3, 5, 8 | 2, 6]

Step 4 – insert 2
[2, 3, 5, 8 | 6]

Step 5 – insert 6
[2, 3, 5, 6, 8]

4️⃣ Algorithm Steps (Formal)

For each element starting from index 1:

Store the current value (key)

Shift all larger elements one position to the right

Insert key in the correct position

5️⃣ Why It’s Called Insertion Sort

Because:

Elements are inserted, not swapped repeatedly

Values are shifted to make room

📌 This is the key difference from Bubble & Selection.

6️⃣ Correct Insertion Sort (TypeScript)
function insertionSort(array: number[]): number[] {
    for (let i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
        const key = array[i];
        let j = i - 1;

        while (j >= 0 && array[j]! > key!) {
            array[j + 1] = array[j]!;
            j--;
        }

        array[j + 1] = key!;
    }
    return array;
}


Time complexities:

| Case                        | Time      |
| --------------------------- | --------- |
| Best case (already sorted)  | **O(n)**  |
| Average case                | **O(n²)** |
| Worst case (reverse sorted) | **O(n²)** |


8️⃣ Space Complexity

O(1) → in-place

No extra memory needed

9️⃣ Stability (Important)

✅ Stable sort

Why?

Equal elements are not reordered

Only elements greater than key are shifted

🔟 Why Insertion Sort Is Actually Used in Industry

This is the part many tutorials miss 👇

✔ Used when:

Arrays are small

Data is nearly sorted

As a helper algorithm inside hybrids

✔ Used inside:

TimSort

IntroSort

V8 JavaScript engine

Java Collections

📌 Insertion sort has tiny overhead and excellent cache locality.


1️⃣2️⃣ Common Mistakes (You Will Avoid These)

❌ Swapping instead of shifting
❌ Forgetting to store key
❌ Wrong loop boundaries
❌ Comparing indexes instead of values

1️⃣3️⃣ Mental Model (Memorize This)

“Everything to the left is sorted.
Take the next card and slide it into place.”

1️⃣4️⃣ Senior Engineer Insight 💡

Insertion Sort is slow asymptotically,
but extremely fast in practice for small or nearly sorted datasets.

This is why it survives in real systems.

1️⃣5️⃣ When NOT to Use Insertion Sort

❌ Large random datasets
❌ When O(n log n) algorithms are available

1️⃣6️⃣ Interview One-Liner

Insertion Sort is a stable, in-place, adaptive sorting algorithm that builds a sorted array one element at a time by shifting larger elements.
