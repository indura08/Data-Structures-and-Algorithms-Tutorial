Now, letâ€™s talk about Dynamic Programming (DP) â€” not as scary as it sounds.

ðŸ’¡ What is Dynamic Programming?
-----------------------------------

Dynamic Programming is a problem-solving technique used to solve problems that:

Can be broken down into smaller subproblems, and

Those subproblems repeat multiple times.

Instead of solving the same subproblem over and over, you solve it once and save the result â€” usually in a table or array â€” and reuse it when needed. This saves a lot of time.

ðŸŽ¯ Real-Life Analogy
----------------------

Imagine youâ€™re climbing stairs and each time you figure out how many ways you can reach step 1, step 2, etc. Instead of recalculating the same steps again and again, you write them down on sticky notes and stick them on each step. Now every time you reach a step, you just look at the sticky note!


ðŸ§± Key Concepts
-----------------

Overlapping subproblems: You keep solving the same smaller problems.

Optimal substructure: The best solution to the big problem depends on the best solutions to its subproblems.

Memoization (top-down): Solve problems recursively and cache results.

Tabulation (bottom-up): Solve smaller problems first and build up a table.


ðŸ§  Example: Fibonacci

The naÃ¯ve way:

int fib(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}


This does tons of repeated work.

DP way (bottom-up):

int fib(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[0] = 0; dp[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}

âœ… 1. Climbing Stairs (Classic DP)
====================================

ðŸ§© Problem:
You can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time. How many ways can you climb to the top of n steps?

ðŸŽ¯ Example:
n = 3

Ways: [1,1,1], [1,2], [2,1] â†’ 3 ways

ðŸ’¡ DP Insight:
To reach step n, you could come from step n-1 or n-2.

So:

dp[n] = dp[n-1] + dp[n-2]


int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;

    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
