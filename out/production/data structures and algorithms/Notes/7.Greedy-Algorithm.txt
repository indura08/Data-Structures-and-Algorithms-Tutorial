🧠 What is a Greedy Algorithm?
---------------------------------

A Greedy algorithm is a strategy where:

At each step, you pick the best immediate choice (the one that looks best right now) — without worrying about the bigger picture.

You're basically being "greedy" — grabbing the most you can at every step — hoping that all those greedy choices lead to the best final result.

🔑 Key Rule:
---------------

Greedy algorithms only work when:

The local best choice also leads to the global best solution.

This is not always true, so greedy only works for certain problems.

✅ Simple Examples
--------------------

💰 Example 1: Coin Change (Limited to Specific Coins)
=========================================================

You want to give someone change for ₹27 using the least number of coins. You have:

Coins of ₹10, ₹5, and ₹1

Greedy Approach:

First pick the biggest coin possible at each step.

₹27 → Take ₹10 → ₹17 left

Take another ₹10 → ₹7 left

Take ₹5 → ₹2 left

Take ₹1 twice → done

✅ Used 5 coins, which is the optimal answer here.

Greedy worked here because bigger coins reduce total faster.

🏃‍♂️ Example 2: Activity Selection
==================================

You’re given activities with a start and end time. You can only do one at a time. Pick the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.

Greedy Trick:

Sort activities by ending time.

Always pick the activity that ends the earliest, so you leave room for more.

✅ Works because choosing the earliest-ending one always gives more time for others.


❌ Where Greedy Fails
-----------------------

Let’s say you have coin values like ₹9, ₹6, and ₹1 and want to make ₹11.

Greedy would pick ₹9 → ₹2 left → ₹1 x2 = 3 coins
But the best is ₹6 + ₹1×5 = 6 coins.

✅ So greedy fails here, because picking the biggest coin at each step doesn't give the best result.


🧪 How to Know If Greedy Will Work?
------------------------------------

Ask:

Does choosing what’s best now guarantee the best outcome?

Is there a proof that local choice = global choice?

If yes, greedy is great.
If no or unsure, use Dynamic Programming instead.

🧠 Honest Tip:
-----------------

If a greedy approach is giving wrong answers on edge cases or large inputs — don’t force it. Try DP or backtracking instead.
